# Discord Self-Bot Voice

![Discord Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Self--Bot--Voice-blue)

A simple and stable Discord self-bot to hang out in voice channels with mic and deafen controls.

## üöÄ What is this?

This is a Discord self-bot built with Node.js that:
- Automatically joins a specified voice channel.
- Allows you to toggle the microphone and deafen status with commands.
- Stays online reliably, even on free hosting like Render.com, with a built-in keep-alive server.

> **Note:** Self-bots violate Discord's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk!

## üåü Features

- **Voice Channel Hangout:** Joins and stays in a voice channel automatically.
- **Mic Control:** Toggle your mic on/off with `!togglemic`.
- **Deafen Control:** Toggle deafen on/off with `!toggledeafen`.
- **Leave Command:** Exit the voice channel with `!leave`.
- **Stability:** Auto-reconnects if disconnected, perfect for long-term use.
- **Render.com Support:** Includes a keep-alive server to prevent shutdown on Render.com.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your self-bot running in minutes!

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Installed locally or use Render.com (no install needed).
- **Discord Account Token:** You‚Äôll need your account token (not a bot token).
- **Voice Channel ID:** The ID of the voice channel you want to join.

### 2. Get Your Token

1. Log into Discord in your browser.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `F12`) to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the Network tab, refresh the page, and filter for any request (e.g., messages).
4. Check the Request Headers > Find Authorization. Copy the value (that‚Äôs your token).

> **Warning:** Keep your token private! Never share it publicly.

### 3. Set Up on Render.com

#### Create a Project:

1. Go to Render.com and click "New Web Service".
2. Choose "Node.js" and name your project (e.g., discord-selfbot-voice).

#### Add Files:

1. Copy the contents of `index.js` and `keep_alive.js` from this project into new files with the same names.

#### Install Dependencies:

In the Render.com shell, run:
```sh
npm install discord.js express
```

#### Configure the Bot:

1. Open `index.js` and replace `VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` with your voice channel ID:
   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord (Settings > Appearance).
   - Right-click the voice channel > "Copy ID".
2. Add your token:
   - Go to the "Environment" tab.
   - Add a new environment variable: Key = `TOKEN`, Value = your Discord account token.

#### Run the Bot:

Click the "Deploy" button. You‚Äôll see logs in the console.

### 4. Keep It Running (Render.com)

Render.com stops idle projects, so use this trick:
1. After running, note the URL in the web preview (e.g., `https://<project-name>.onrender.com`).
2. Go to UptimeRobot:
   - Sign up and create a new HTTP(s) monitor.
   - Set the URL to your Render.com URL and check every 5 minutes.
3. The `keep_alive.js` server will respond to pings, keeping your bot online!

## üéÆ Commands

| Command       | Description                  |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `!togglemic`  | Turn your mic on or off      |
| `!toggledeafen` | Turn deafen on or off       |
| `!leave`      | Leave the voice channel      |

> **Tip:** Send these commands in any text channel the bot can see (it only responds to your own messages).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

- **Mic/Deafen Default:** Edit `MIC_ENABLED` or `DEAFEN_ENABLED` in `index.js` (true = on, false = off).
- **Reconnect Delay:** Change `RECONNECT_DELAY` (in milliseconds) if you want faster/slower reconnection attempts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Risk:** Using a self-bot can get your Discord account banned. Use a secondary account if possible.
- **Limitations:** This bot only controls Discord‚Äôs mic/deafen settings, not your actual hardware.
- **Support:** Stuck? Ask for help in the comments or wherever you found this code!
